## 🔑 Key Features

### Security
- ✅ Authentication required for all operations
- ✅ Users can only upload/delete their own avatars
- ✅ Private bucket with signed URLs (24h expiration)
- ✅ File type validation (jpg, png, gif, webp only)
- ✅ File size validation (5MB maximum)

### Functionality
- ✅ Click avatar to upload
- ✅ Automatic old avatar deletion on new upload
- ✅ Delete button for removing avatar
- ✅ Loading states during upload/delete
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Automatic profile refresh after operations
- ✅ Signed URL auto-fetch on page load

### User Experience
- ✅ Visual feedback (loading spinner, hover effects)
- ✅ Fallback to initials when no avatar
- ✅ Edit button overlay on avatar
- ✅ Confirmation dialog for deletion
- ✅ Error messages displayed inline
- ✅ Responsive design

## 🎯 Technical Flow

### Upload Process
1. User clicks avatar → file input opens
2. User selects file → validation (client-side)
3. FormData POST to `/api/profile/avatar`
4. Server validates auth + file
5. Generate unique filename: `{userId}-{timestamp}.{ext}`
6. Delete old avatar if exists
7. Upload to S3 "avatar" bucket
8. Update `profiles.avatar_url` in database
9. Generate signed URL (24h)
10. Return signed URL to client
11. Client refreshes profile data

### Display Process
1. Profile page loads
2. Check if `profile.avatar_url` exists
3. If exists, fetch signed URL from `/api/profile/avatar/url`
4. Display image with signed URL
5. If no avatar, show fallback (initials)

### Delete Process
1. User clicks "Remove avatar"
2. Confirmation dialog
3. DELETE to `/api/profile/avatar`
4. Server deletes file from storage
5. Server sets `profiles.avatar_url` to null
6. Client refreshes profile data

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables (.env.local)
```env
# Existing Supabase variables
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...

# New S3 variables (required for avatar upload)
ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_supabase_s3_access_key
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_supabase_s3_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1  # Optional
```

### Supabase Setup
1. ✅ "avatar" bucket created (private)
2. ✅ `profiles.avatar_url` column exists (TEXT, nullable)
3. 🔄 RLS policies (optional, recommended) - see AVATAR_SETUP.md

## 📊 Database Schema
```sql
-- The avatar_url column should exist in your profiles table
-- It stores the path like: "avatar/user-id-timestamp.jpg"
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS avatar_url TEXT;
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] "avatar" bucket exists in Supabase Storage
- [ ] Bucket is set to private
- [ ] Upload image < 5MB (jpg/png/gif/webp)
- [ ] Avatar displays on profile page
- [ ] Delete avatar works
- [ ] Old avatar is deleted when uploading new one
- [ ] Error handling works (wrong file type, too large, etc.)
- [ ] Loading states display correctly
- [ ] Signed URLs work (private bucket access)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add avatar to other pages** - Use the signed URL endpoint to display avatars in:
   - Dashboard
   - User lists (therapist/patient views)
   - Navigation header

2. **Image processing** - Add server-side image optimization:
   - Resize to standard dimensions (e.g., 200x200)
   - Compress to reduce file size
   - Generate thumbnails

3. **Cropping UI** - Add client-side image cropping before upload

4. **Progress indicator** - Show upload progress percentage

5. **Drag & drop** - Add drag-and-drop zone for file upload

6. **Multiple formats** - Add support for more formats (svg, bmp, etc.)

7. **CDN caching** - Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed avatars

## 📝 Notes

- Signed URLs expire after 24 hours (configurable in code)
- File naming: `{userId}-{timestamp}.{extension}` ensures uniqueness
- S3-compatible API works with Supabase Storage endpoint
- The bucket is private, so all access requires authentication and signed URLs
- Old avatars are automatically cleaned up to prevent storage bloat
