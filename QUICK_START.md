# Avatar Upload - Quick Start

## ðŸš€ Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies âœ…
Already installed: `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`

### 2. Add Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_supabase_s3_access_key_here
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_supabase_s3_secret_key_here
```

**Where to get these:**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Storage â†’ Settings â†’ S3 Access Keys
- Generate new keys and copy them

### 3. Verify Database
Your `profiles` table should already have the `avatar_url` column (it's in your Profile type).

If not, run:
```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;
```

### 4. Verify Bucket
Make sure you have an "avatar" bucket in Supabase Storage set to **private**.

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### Backend
- âœ… `/api/profile/avatar` - POST to upload, DELETE to remove
- âœ… `/api/profile/avatar/url` - GET signed URL
- âœ… S3 client with upload, delete, and signed URL generation
- âœ… File validation (5MB max, jpg/png/gif/webp only)
- âœ… Automatic old avatar cleanup

### Frontend  
- âœ… Profile page with avatar upload UI
- âœ… Click avatar to upload
- âœ… File validation with error messages
- âœ… Loading states
- âœ… Delete button
- âœ… Automatic signed URL fetching

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use

### As a User
1. Go to `/profile` page
2. Click on your avatar circle
3. Select an image file (< 5MB, jpg/png/gif/webp)
4. Wait for upload (loading spinner shows)
5. Your avatar appears automatically!
6. Click "Remove avatar" to delete

### As a Developer
```typescript
import { uploadAvatar, deleteAvatar } from '@/lib/authClient';

// Upload
const file = ...; // File from input
const result = await uploadAvatar(file);
console.log(result.signed_url); // Use this URL to display

// Delete
await deleteAvatar();
```

## ðŸ§ª Test It

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Log in to your app
3. Go to profile page
4. Click avatar and upload an image
5. See it display immediately!
